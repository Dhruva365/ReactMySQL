# ReactMySQL


Here in this I have created a Login Page as frontend, and also have created database using phpmyadmin in Xamapp server. 
Project consist of a backend server where through an api the database content is been fetched and displayed on the serverpage. 
To render the frontend we create react app using vite, where using fetch api we fetch the url of backend server and then try to login to only those users whose data is matched with the data in the database.
